# ReelRead AI

ReelRead AI is an entertainment-focused agent built with Django and Google Gemini.  
It provides personalized movie and book recommendations and connects to Telex through the A2A workflow system.



## Overview

ReelRead AI uses Gemini for natural conversation and Django for backend logic.  
It responds to messages about movies, books, and shows, avoiding plot spoilers and unrelated topics.  
The app is deployed to Railway and integrated with Telex to act as an A2A coworker.



## Features

- Movie and book recommendations powered by Google Gemini  
- JSON-RPC 2.0 support for Telex communication  
- Context-aware responses  
- Django-based API endpoint  
- Clear separation of chat logic and request handling



## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django  
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini API

## Telex Configuration

`telex.json`

```json
{
  "category": "entertainment",
  "description": "Get personalized movie and book recommendations",
  "id": "reelread_agent_v1",
  "name": "ReelRead AI",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "reelread_agent",
      "name": "ReelRead Agent",
      "type": "a2a/generic-a2a-node",
      "url": "https://reelreadrecommender.up.railway.app/reelread"
    }
  ]
}
```

This file connects the Telex platform to the Django endpoint.
Once uploaded, Telex will send user messages to `/reelread` and return responses generated by Gemini.

## Testing with Postman

Send a POST request to your `/reelread` endpoint with the following structure:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "message/send",
  "params": {
    "message": {
      "parts": [
        {
          "kind": "text",
          "text": "Suggest a romantic movie."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}


## Deployment

The app can be deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/) or any platform that supports Django and environment variables.
After deployment, update the Telex node URL in `telex.json` to match your live endpoint.
